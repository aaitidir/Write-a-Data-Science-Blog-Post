## Installations

This project was created and run using Python version 3.0.

>1) You will need to download Montreal’s towing operations data.
https://donnees.montreal.ca/ville-de-montreal/remorquages-de-vehicules-genants
>Get the : "Remorquages après le 15 nov 2015"  file
 
>2) Store it in the project folder to be read by read_csv
  pd.read_csv("./remorquages.csv")


## Motivations
The city of Montreal has an open data platform that provides a data set with relevant information about the towing operations.

As Montreal is divided in boroughs we will explore the relation between the boroughs and the towing operations.

    Witch districts are the most impacted by parking issues ?
    Are there street that have more problematic ?
    Is there a road type that is more problematic ?

Then we will explore the impact of the seasons.

Finally as the city tries to address the issue each year we will explore the evolution over time.
